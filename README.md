# MyReads

---

## The Project

This is the first project of the Udacity React Nanodegree Program. The purpose of the project is to test and get practice developing react-based apps.

## Running the App

If you do not have Node installed, go to: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Clone the repository and cd into the project's directory.

```
git clone git@github.com:DiegoGasques/myreads.git
cd /myreads
```

Install dependencies and run the app locally.

```
npm install
npm start
```

## App Specifications

- The initial page includes three bookshelves ("currently reading", "want to read" and "read").
- Each book has a control selector that allows the user to change the shelf of the book.
- There is a button (+) that takes the user to the search page.
- Users can search for books on the search page.
- The selections the user makes on the search page will appear in the respective shelf on the initial page.

## Important

The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
